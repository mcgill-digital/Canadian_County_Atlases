# Canadian County Atlases

[In Search of Your Canadian Past: The Canadian County Atlas Digital Project](https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/countyatlas), created by McGill University Library in the late 1990s, provides access to 32 Ontario county atlases which were produced between 1874 and 1881.  Of interest to genealogists, the atlases contain indexes of persons residing in each county and these have been digitized and are searchable on the abovementioned website.

McGill_County_Atlas_Project_people_index.csv is an extract of the people index used by the website, along with URLs for each record. The CSV contains 172927 records with the following fields:
title (e.g. Mr., Mrs., Prof.), first name, last name, township name, town name, county name, atlas date, URL

The csv made available here was originally extracted at the request of The Ontario Genealogical Society for inclusion in The Ontario Name Index in April 2020.
